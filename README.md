## Command line game of Town, Country, River

This is a simple command line helper for playing the game of Town, Country, River (Stop/Adedanha in pt-br).

To play the game, simply run `python index.py` and follow the instructions.

PS. Since I was playing this game mostly in portuguese, some of the letters of the alphabet were very difficult to play with and had to be removed. If you wish to add or remove any letters, just go to the `index.py` file and change the `letters` list.
